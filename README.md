# NS-Baby-Names

Recently I found out that a co-worker was having a hard time finding a name for her soon-to-be-born child. Coincidentally, I stumbled on an [open data set from the Nova Scotia government](https://data.novascotia.ca/Population-and-Demographics/NS-Top-Twenty-Baby-Names-1920-2016/emf8-vmuy) which shows the top 20 baby names per year by gender. [I used this data to create a quick visualization](http://charts.zone/) to allow people to play around with this data more easily, and it was shown off during her baby shower. This was also a good excuse to play around with Shiny.
